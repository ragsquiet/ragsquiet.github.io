## Long Time

It has taken me a while to start this blog. Very often, I find myself wanting to write down an idea, an imagination, a rumination or even post a picture. But then hesitating 
cause I didn't know where and then not wanting to write it just anywhere, completely
abandoning the desire. 

It most likely is cause i have not put away a set of pen and a diary away.. a set of 
things where I coould most comfortably write. But now with the help of github, jekyll 
and a simpel guide - got me a my kind of a blog space.

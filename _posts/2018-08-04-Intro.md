## Long Time

It has taken me a while to start this blog. Very often, I find myself wanting to write down an idea, an imagination, a rumination or even post a picture. But then hesitating 
cause I didn't know where and then not wanting to write it just anywhere, completely
abandoning the desire. 

It most likely is cause i have not put away a set of pen and a diary away.. a set of 
things where I coould most comfortably write. But now with the help of github, jekyll 
and a simple enough guide - got me a my kind of a blog space.


## The Blog

I have a simple blog thing going on right now. I am sure i can update the theme in the
coming days. A simple Black and white theme will be awesome. However, all i have down
for now is
	1. Forked  a jekyll repository [jekyll Now](http://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now/)
	2. Renamed it to my githubname.github.io
	3. Updated the simple ideas in _ _config.yml_ file 
	4. And that's it.

It has been a very straight forward thing to do. Excellent instructions !

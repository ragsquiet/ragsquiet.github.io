### More Information

I am a computer scientist who works in the area of artificial intelligence. I live in Dehradun where I moved 10 years from San Francisco where I had been living and working for about 14 years. My life journey has had many phases and in most of them I found myself exploring a part of myself for some time and eventually moving on. I have explored Spirituality and along with it some amounts of Poetry, Science, Mathematics and Philosophy with varying amounts of seriousness. I enjoy good food, kind people and deep conversations. It is my belief that there is a lot of possibility in each one of us to become more sensible in the way we live our lives and in the process make the human situation slightly better. Science and Philosophy has a lot to teach us in this regard and exploring this knowledge and wisdom can be very worthwhile for us all.

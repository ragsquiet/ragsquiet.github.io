Intuition is the seed. It has to effortfully become knowledge in this world as it grows. Knowledge becomes Actions as it gains confidence. Actions bear outcomes that nourish it all... We call all of this 'I' !

Some seekers seek the seed. Some seek knowlegde. Some want to understand Actions and thus it goes.

I find all of this very compelling and have spent some time, sampling from all. I guess i am trying to get the sense of the 'I'. 

I live in Dehradun, India. I am a Data Scientist and an AI Engineer.
